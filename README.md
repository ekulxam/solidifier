# Solidifier
Dynamic implementation of https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/soilify

Tries to turn as many textures as possible into a texture of your choice
(by default, this is vanilla dirt)

### Config
- Texture: the texture to change things to (parsed as an Identifier)
- Change GUI: Whether the texture should be applied to all GUI elements (still applies to some without, but the game becomes unreadable with this enabled)
- Change Atlases: Whether the atlas textures should be changed to the texture
- Debug: Whether debug logging should be enabled
